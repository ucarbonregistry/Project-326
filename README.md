4 MW Small Scale Solar Power Project by M/s Chiripal Poly Films Ltd.

The proposed project activity with title under UCR “4 MW Small Scale Solar Power Project by M/s
Chiripal Poly Films Ltd.”, is a grid connected renewable power generation activity which incorporates
installation and operation ground mounted Solar Photovoltaic power generation project in the state of
Gujarat in India. The project has aggregated installed capacity of 3999.90 kW DC. The project is an
operational activity with continuous reduction of GHG, currently being applied under “Universal Carbon
Registry” (UCR).

The project activity aims to harness Solar radiation of sun which is a renewable source, to generate
electricity. The net generated electricity from the project activity is consumed by the manufacturing
facility of the PP. The promoter of the project activity is ‘M/s Chiripal Poly Films Ltd.’ (herein after
called as Project Proponent or PP). PP has the 100% ownership of the project activity. A Wheeling
agreement has been signed between PP and Uttar Gujarat Vij Company Ltd (UGVCL). In pre-project
scenario the State utility was importing the required electricity from the NEWNE grid to meet its
requirement of electrical energy. Currently, NEWNE grid is connected to large numbers of fossil fuelbased power plants. Hence, project activity is displacing the gross electricity generation i.e., 3363.66
MWh from the NEWNE grid, which otherwise would have been imported from the grid. The project
activity doesn’t involve any GHG emission sources.


The project activity involves Ground Mounted Polycrystalline Waaree Photovoltaic (PV) Plant having
installed capacity of 3999.90 kW DC. The project activity uses Polycrystalline Mono PERC Waaree solar
photovoltaic technology to generate clean energy. Solar radiation is converted directly into electricity by
solar cells (photovoltaic cells). In such cells, a small electric voltage is generated when light strikes the
junction between a metal and a semiconductor (such as silicon) or the junction between two different
semiconductors. Photovoltaic module consists of several photovoltaic cells connected by circuits and
sealed in an environmentally protective laminate, which forms the fundamental building blocks of the
complete PV generating unit. Several PV panels mounted on a frame are termed as PV Array.
